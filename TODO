- 1 calculation method is finished: RaidSubmit. This generates an array with records. Each record looks like this:
    * at: Attack
    * df: Defense
    * st: Stamina
    * hp: Hitpoints
    * iv: IV
    * pct: percentage
  ==> This needs to be displayed in the table.

- Watch out for handling Error()'s. I throw them when something goes wrong. Maybe this is not the correct JavaScript way? But these should be shown with the message in them.


- When you go to a different tab, the URL should change (for example change the anchor to #iv, #cp, ...). This is important as I want every "tab" to be able to be bookmarked.
- Linked to this previous point is that if you go for example to raid calculation & press refresh. It should come back to raid calculation. (ie: bookmarkable)


- The values should be saved. So for example I was testing the Raid with "Terrakion" and CP 2593 with the "Raid" button checked. This should be saved.


- When you are in the mobile browser and open the app:
  When you click on the menu it shows all (good).
  When you click one entry, the menu doesn't disappear. What I prefer is that that menu item becomes the "header" in the gray block, and the others disappear.


- Dropdown box for Pokemons:
  * Sort by name
  * I was looking if it's possible to have a similar entry field as on gamepress: so you can type stuff (for example "ter"), and it would show all entries where "ter" is in the name.
    ==> Couldn't immediately find a plugin for that but it would surprise me if there isn't one. Could you add this behaviour?


- CP Calculator:
  Add a dropdown box "Evolve into". By default this should be empty, but upon change of "Pokemon" dropdown it should change into the nice_name's from "get_possible_evolutions(<nice_name>)"
